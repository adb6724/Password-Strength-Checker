# Password-Strength-Checker

This program allows passwords to be added to a text file and ran through code that queries its strength.
There are specific forms of C that I wanted to test myself with, so I went the long route instead of using simpler code.

The program calls for the three test files and tests them depending of the tests they ask for. The files specify length of passwords and phrases, letter case, symbols, and etc. 

The program returns the # of tests passed, failed and which tests it failed. If a password passes 4 tests, it is considered strong, and the program displays so.

The output follows
